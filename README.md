# py-VolcChem

This is a python package that I am building for common geochemical plots used in volcanology. 
It is work in progress, and its main purpose is for students in my petrology class to have easy access to these plots.
Feel free to use them, feedback is welcomed.

# List of plots
Bulk Rock, Matrix Glass, Melt Inclusion Classification:
1. TAS Diagram
2. Tholeiitic vs Calc-Alkaline 
3. SiO2 vs K2O: useful to classify rocks from arc environments
